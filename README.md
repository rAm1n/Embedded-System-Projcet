# Smart maid, a software/hardware codesign
*Afshin Rodgar, Ramin Fahimi*


### Project goal
In this project we aim to design and build an embedded system as an smart maid for a house, this system will be connected to an smart phone thorough an interface getting prompt and schedules to activate certain services. This command will be in both voice or human-computer interaction.

### Project approach
This model will have specific sensors for detecting current state of the house and commands by user, a state chart will be design for more insight in each state and transition between them. Software part of our system will be in charge for modeling our entire system while the hardware part is reading sensor and writing on actuators commanded by software part. A voice recognition engine muse be designed to detect different form of commands filtered by personal profile and behavior created manually or automatically. For further investigation in the area we can think of an artificial intelligence based design, learned by user behavior for an smoother and better management but that'll not covered in this project.

### Resources
For implementation we appointed the need of a "raspberry pi" computer, a network module, an smart phone device, some casual sensors and actuators (based on what want to do) beside an application interface for connecting devices through network and another for controlling "the smart maid".
